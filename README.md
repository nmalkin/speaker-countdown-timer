# Speaker Countdown Timer

This is a simple countdown timer designed for showing speakers how much of their allotted time is left.

To minimize distraction, it shows, at first, only the (rounded) number of minutes. Once two minutes are left, the exact time remaining is displayed. When time runs out, the countdown turns negative and continues.

The software is made using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and can be hosted statically. To build it, run `npm run build`.
